I am an aspiring Data Analyst hoping to make a positive impact on the world. All my life I have been seeking a way to both improve the world while also finding new, deeper connections to it. I sought it in History while at college. Then in my first career which was in the craft beer industry. However, neither of these paths had the direct impact I had hoped they had. In Data Analysis I have found a connection that is direct, tangible, applicable, and effective.
